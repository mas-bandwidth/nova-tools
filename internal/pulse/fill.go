// Fill is fill-loop.sh's tick body as one verb (#1142): for each bench, read the bench's
// capacity, cap it at FillCap, pop that many card-<n>.md from --ready in filename order,
// move each to --launched and hand it to the launcher. One FILL line per tick, no model
// call.
//
// A card may name a LANE (`LANE: <name>`), and a lane is a serial queue over one area of
// the codebase: at most one live card per lane at a time. A ready card whose lane already
// has a live card -- one under --launched, or one launched earlier in this tick -- is held
// in order with a FILL HELD line and stays ready. A LANE the lanes file does not name is
// refused with the remedy, once per card per lanes-file mtime: the refusal leaves a marker
// beside the card, so a lane nobody has added does not reprint its refusal every five
// minutes, and editing the lanes file makes every refusal speak again. A card with no LANE
// is launched exactly as before.
//
// A launcher that fails is not a card that ran. The card goes back to --ready with a
// `.failed-<n>` marker naming the attempt and the reason, its lane is released, and the
// tick counts it under failed= rather than launched= -- the dogfood edge of 2026-09-18,
// where an exit-7 launcher left a card under --launched holding its lane forever while the
// tick read launched=1.
//
// WHERE a card may go is not the caller's opinion: --machines names the machines registry
// (internal/fleet), and a bench whose roles lack `bench` is refused BY NAME before any ssh
// is opened -- exit 2, nothing launched. That is Glenn's lock of 2026-09-18: runner hosts
// are CI-only, and a card on a machine serving the merge group's shards makes the shard
// slow, the gate red and the queue stop. The guard is in three places on purpose: the whole
// bench list is checked before the first tick, and then EVERY capacity read and EVERY launch
// goes through a wrapper that asks the registry again -- so a bench name that arrives by
// some other road later still cannot reach a runner host.
//
// The two things that touch the world -- the capacity formula on a bench and the per-card
// launch -- are injected seams (Capacity and CardLauncher), so a test drives the whole
// tick against a fake ready directory, a fake clock and a fake launcher. No test opens an
// ssh connection or spawns a process.
