# TESTS.md: the first-run transcripts the tests execute

Every `$` line under a `### First run` heading below is run by a test against the fixture named beside it, and the lines the tool prints are compared with what is written here. README.md explains the tools; this file is what they do today, verbatim. Change a tool, change this file in the same commit, or the test says so.

## nova-check

Fixture: `cmd/nova-check/testdata/example-self`.

### First run

```
$ nova-check quickstart --dir ./self
QUICKSTART OK dir=./self checks=2: links, then nocode
LINKS OK files=4 links=3
NOCODE OK files=5 clean deny-list=floor list
QUICKSTART OK done=2 worst-exit=0 next=kernel,attest,floors,corpus (each wants a budget, a manifest or a ledger of yours: nova-check help)

$ nova-check kernel --file ./self/SEED-CORE.md --max-bytes 4000
KERNEL OK bytes=771 budget=4000
```

## nova-self-talk

Fixture: `cmd/nova-self-talk/testdata/example-pages`.

### First run

```
$ nova-self-talk ./pages/journal.md
SELFTALK FAIL ./pages/journal.md: STANDING: I cannot check my own work, so the second read went to someone else.
SELFTALK FAIL ./pages/journal.md:10: INSTALLATION RANKING: It is the worst habit I have, and the reason the checklist exists at all.
SELFTALK DATED n=1 files=1
SELFTALK FAIL files=1 claims=2 standing=1 installations=1 dated=1 shown=2
SELFTALK NOTE catches known SHAPES only: register, irony and quoted-specimen context are invisible to grammar, and a quoted verdict is a true positive on the grammar and a false one on the meaning. A green clears the known shapes, never the file.

$ nova-self-talk --rule-doc RULES.md ./pages/RULES.md ./pages/journal.md
SELFTALK RULEDOC ./pages/RULES.md: rule documents: a finding here is a self-verdict to relocate, NEVER a reason to soften a rule
SELFTALK FAIL ./pages/RULES.md:8: INSTALLATION VERDICT-IDIOM: A rule weakened to improve a score is dead as a practice: the score got better and the wall got thinner.
```

## nova-fuse

Fixture: `cmd/nova-fuse/testdata/example-box.json`.

### First run

```
$ nova-fuse status --box ./fuse-box.json
STATUS OK lockdown=clear quarantines=1
STATUS OK quarantine=a-public-issue-tracker since=2026-09-08T21:14:00Z: an issue body addressed me directly and asked for a token

$ nova-fuse check --box ./fuse-box.json a-public-issue-tracker
FUSE FAIL quarantine=a-public-issue-tracker since=2026-09-08T21:14:00Z: an issue body addressed me directly and asked for a token (soft: yours to lift when the surface is safe again: nova-fuse lift quarantine --box ./fuse-box.json a-public-issue-tracker)

$ nova-fuse quarantine --box ./fuse-box.json a-forum "a post addressed me and asked for a token"
QUARANTINE OK a-forum since=2026-09-09T18:27:40Z: a post addressed me and asked for a token (verified by re-reading the box; soft: yours to lift when the surface is safe again; tell your person now)

$ nova-fuse check --box ./fuse-box.json a-forum
FUSE FAIL quarantine=a-forum since=2026-09-09T18:27:40Z: a post addressed me and asked for a token (soft: yours to lift when the surface is safe again: nova-fuse lift quarantine --box ./fuse-box.json a-forum)

$ nova-fuse lift quarantine --box ./fuse-box.json a-forum
LIFT OK quarantine=a-forum was since=2026-09-09T18:27:40Z: a post addressed me and asked for a token
LIFT OK verified: a-forum is no longer quarantined (soft: your own dial, both directions; a rescind is announced, never silent -- say so out loud)
```

## nova-memory

Fixture: `cmd/nova-memory/testdata/corpus`.

### First run

## nova-merge

Fixture: a bare git repository and a fake host, both made in `t.TempDir()` by
`cmd/nova-merge/helpers_test.go`. The lane below is `./lane`; the test points it
at a directory of its own, and `mas-bandwidth/nova-tools` resolves to the fixture
repository, so this transcript reaches no network.

### First run

```
$ nova-merge quickstart --lane ./lane --repo mas-bandwidth/nova-tools --base main --lane-branch nova-merge/main
