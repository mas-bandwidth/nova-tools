## The card, as `cut` writes it

```
RESULT <label> sha=<sha12>
You are a worker. Job directory only; the TMPDIR the runner already exported, never one of your own; never /tmp, ~ or ..; no stdlib or toolchain source; the deadline is the machinery's: <s> s.
STEP 1. mkdir -p scratch && git clone -q https://github.com/<owner>/<name>.git . && git checkout -b <branch>
   check: git rev-parse HEAD prints <head>. Else write RESULT.md with line 2 BLOCKED head=<yours> and stop.
STEP 2..n. <the template's numbered steps, one command per line, one check each>
STEP last. Write RESULT.md: line 1 exactly the line 1 of this card; line 2 one of DONE, ABSTAIN <why>, BLOCKED <why>; then BRANCH <branch>; REPO <owner>/<name>; then the RESULT template's sections.
```

`<sha12>` is the first twelve hex of the SHA-256 of everything below line 1, so the contract
line binds the card it heads; the swarm records the same hash at admission and refuses a
`RESULT.md` whose line 1 differs (SPEC-SWARM, **gather**). Text templates add rule 6's line
after line 2. `<head>` is the repo's default-branch head at cut time, read once per repo per
`cut` run; a candidate whose repo cannot be read is `skipped` with the reason, never cut blind.
