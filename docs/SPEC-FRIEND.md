# SPEC-FRIEND: what a friend runs to be part of the team

The tool is `nova-friend`; the rules are `internal/friend`; the machine is
`tla/Friend.tla`. The contract was settled on 2026-10-04 between the owner and
the coordinator: "everything that a friend needs in any harness, to be a part
of the team", "it must be this way when they start up next time, not just now,
but always", and "like a network connection: client/server and the coordinator
is the server; both sides need to know they are connected, continually".

## The pattern in one sentence

One daemon per friend, started by launchd and never by the model, parks on the
friend's nova-bus2 stream and pushes each message into the running session as
a turn; it beats to the sprint server while that loop runs and only then; it
answers the coordinator's ping at once and pushes the ping in, and the
session's own answer, a turn carrying the ping's nonce, is the only thing that
makes the friend up.

## The data

- The bus: the friend's stream `bus2:to:<friend>` (SPEC-BUS2.md). A message is
  pending from the read until the session's turn ends at exit 0, so a daemon
  that dies mid-turn is handed the message again once its claim opens, fifteen
  minutes after the read (`ClaimAfter`, SPEC-BUS2.md: longer than the longest
  turn, so a live daemon mid-turn is never handed its message twice).
- The files, one writer each. The state files live in the state directory,
  `~/.nova-friend/<friend>` under the home directory unless `--state-dir` names
  another, never on the friend's volume (a background process on this platform
  may not touch a removable volume without the person's permission; measured
  2026-10-04, the mkdir refused with "operation not permitted"): `status.json`
  (the daemon: its state, rewritten whole every five seconds and when it
  changes; a reader calls the daemon up while the file is under thirty seconds
  old), `pong.json` (the `pong` verb: the session's last answer), `deliver.log`
  (the daemon: one line per delivery). The queue file is under the friend's
  working directory: `inbox/QUEUE.json` (the coordinator and the session: one
  record per task with `id`, `state` of queued, working or done, and
  `deliverable`).
- The launchd agent `com.nova.friend-<friend>`: RunAtLoad, KeepAlive, a five
  second throttle. launchd opens its own log before the daemon runs and cannot
  open one on a network volume (EX_CONFIG, measured 2026-10-03), so that log
  is under the home directory, beside the state directory.

## The protocol

- `PING <nonce>`: from the coordinator, subject `PING <nonce>`, body the nonce,
  `seat=<coordinator> since=<RFC3339>`, and the one `nova-friend pong` line the
  session runs. The nonce is six random characters.
- `daemon-pong <nonce>`: the daemon's answer, sent the moment the ping is read,
  or seen by a peek while a turn is running. It proves transport.
- `pong <nonce> queue=<n> working=<n> width=<n>`: the session's answer, sent by
  `nova-friend pong` as the session's own turn and recorded in the pong file.
  It proves the AI. The coordinator reads it from the friend's own stream (the
  message's `from`), never from the body: a pong is forgeable only by the
  friend's login.
- Width is the nova-config friend row's, given to the daemon at install.

## The machine (tla/Friend.tla)

The connection: `connected` while a ping arrived within the window (three
minutes, one number on both sides); `silent` after a window without one, said
to the session as a turn exactly once per outage, and `coordinator back` once
when pings resume, naming the seat. The challenge: `quiet`; `challenged` from a
ping until the session's pong with that nonce; `deaf` after a window challenged
with no pong, until a pong. Only the current nonce answers: a stale or replayed
pong changes nothing. Up is `quiet` with at least one pong; the daemon's beat
never makes a friend up.

The invariants, each with a reversed witness that TLC catches: a friend is up
only after a session pong; a challenge is open for less than a window; the
outage is said exactly once; only the current nonce ends a challenge; and a
challenge ends.

## The loop (internal/friend/daemon.go)

Each second: the clock is stepped; when the session is free, one read of the
stream (a ping is answered by the daemon at once and the message is handed to
the adapter, which blocks for the whole turn, and acked when the turn ends at
exit 0; any other exit leaves it pending, handed in again when its claim opens,
and the third failure acks it with `given_up=true` on the record, so a message
the session cannot take never comes back for ever; a delivery the adapter
defers, `Deferred`, the session unable to take a turn now with nothing wrong,
such as a Codex thread open in the app holding its writer lock, is neither a
failure nor an ack: the message stays in the daemon's hand, tried again every
ten seconds, `RecheckEvery`, and counted toward nothing, so a chat open all
day loses no message, and the record says so at the first deferral and once a
minute after), else one peek, so a ping that
lands during a long turn is still answered at once by the daemon and pushed
in once the session is free; the worker's result; one beat to the sprint
server (`friend beat <friend>`, a plain beat: the queue, working and width
flags are owed on the server's side); the pong file, while a challenge is
open; the status file.

The deliver adapter runs the harness directly, never through a shell, as its
own session leader; past the ten minute budget the whole process group is
signalled, SIGTERM then SIGKILL, so a harness that forks leaves no orphan.
Four adapters are real: OpenCode, `opencode run --session <id> --dir <dir>
<text>`, the newest session of the directory when none is named; and Codex,
Antigravity and Grok, each below. A ping pushed in carries, at its head, the
exact `pong` line for this friend (the binary by path, the name, the
directory, the store, the nonce), so a small model has one line to run and
nothing to fill in. Claude and DSH have no deliver command yet: their daemon
is passive, taking nothing off the stream (the session's own blocking read
does), peeking so a ping is still answered by the daemon at once, beating,
and recording a push it cannot deliver; so the tool is honest, and the beat
and the daemon pong are real for them.

Codex delivers by resume, not into the open chat: `codex exec resume
--skip-git-repo-check <thread> <text>` resumes the saved thread in a new codex
process, so the thread's model answers with the friend's whole context, and
the record labels every such turn "answered by resume, not by the open
chat". The open chat itself is out of reach: the Codex desktop app
(ChatGPT.app) runs its app-server on a stdio pair it owns and listens on no
socket, and while a thread is open there the app holds its writer lock
(`~/.codex/thread-writer-locks/<thread>.lock`), which refuses a resume
("thread <id> already has an active writer", measured 2026-10-04 on an open
thread, exit 1). Without --session, the adapter resolves the newest saved thread with the
same working directory from session_meta headers and session_index updated_at
under CODEX_HOME (otherwise ~/.codex); without a matching thread it refuses
with a remedy rather than spawning codex. It probes that exact thread's writer
lock first (the same flock codex takes). While held, it returns Deferred without
running codex: no failure is counted and nothing is acked or given up, even
after 1,000 deferrals. The daemon retries every ten seconds. The probe releases
its brief exclusive lock before resume, so a writer can still acquire it in
that window; this observation is not a reservation. Reaching the open chat needs the app on the shared local daemon:
the app connects to `~/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock`
instead of its own stdio server only when launched with
`CODEX_APP_SERVER_USE_LOCAL_DAEMON=1` and a daemon is already up (`codex
app-server daemon start`; read from the app bundle, unverified); then `codex
queue --thread <id> --message <text>` reaches the open chat, and the adapter
should move to it.

### Antigravity

Antigravity (Google's agent IDE, 2.19.1 as measured) has no deliver command
of its own, but its agents message each other through the language server,
and that channel takes a message from outside: `agentapi send-message
--title=nova-friend <conversation> <text>`, `agentapi` being the wrapper under
`~/.gemini/antigravity/bin` that execs the app's `language_server`. The
server writes the text into the conversation's mailbox,
`~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/<conversation>/.system_generated/messages/`, as
a high-priority message, its watcher starts a turn on it, and the session
marks it read in `read.json` there as it takes it. Measured 2026-10-04 08:52
ET: sent at :28, the turn's first step at :32, the friend's "got it" on
nova-bus2 at :35.

The adapter finds everything each delivery, so a restarted app is found
again: the server's pid and CSRF token off `ps -axo user=,pid=,args=` for the daemon's own user (the
`language_server` with `--override_ide_name antigravity` and its
`--csrf_token`), its listening ports from `lsof -Fn`, and the port that
answers `get-conversation-metadata` for the conversation (the other is TLS).
Without `--session`, the conversation is the newest root conversation whose
workspace is the friend's directory (or its real path), from the harness's
`conversation_summaries.db`, read immutable through `sqlite3 -json`; that
table is written when a turn ends, so it names the session and never the
turn. The command runs through `/usr/bin/env` with
`ANTIGRAVITY_LS_ADDRESS` and `ANTIGRAVITY_CSRF_TOKEN` set, the text an
argument; the token is already on the server's own command line, readable
by every process of the login, so the delivery exposes nothing the harness
does not.

The ack: `agentapi` exits 0 on an error too (a wrong conversation, a missing
token print `"error"` in its JSON), so the JSON is read and its exit code is
not. The delivery is exit 0 once a new message titled exactly `nova-friend` has appeared in the mailbox
and `read.json` marks it read, polled every half second for two minutes; past
that it is exit 1 with the message id, the message still in the mailbox for
the session's next turn, and the daemon redelivers (a duplicate, never a
loss). The turn the message starts runs on after the ack: a second message
queues in the mailbox rather than waiting for the turn, which is the
harness's own order for its agents. The mailbox and `agentapi` are the
harness's internals for its subagents and scheduled tasks, not a documented
API; a release that moves them breaks this adapter, and the functional test
(`NOVA_FRIEND_ANTIGRAVITY_DIR`) says so.

Grok, the Grok Build TUI (xAI's `grok`), is another real adapter, by the
only door the open window has. The harness has no deliver verb, no leader
socket unless leader mode is on, and `grok -p <text> --resume <id>` runs the
turn in a second process over the same transcript, not in the window the
friend is in. What the window has is its monitor tool: a background task
whose every new output line becomes a notification in the conversation and
wakes the agent for a turn (the harness's guide, `20-background-tasks.md`).
The friend's session runs one over a wake file, `tail -n 0 -F <file>.wake`,
and a line appended to that file arrives as a `<monitor-event>` user turn
(measured 2026-10-04 in a friend's session). The adapter finds the window open
in `--dir` in the harness's `~/.grok/active_sessions.json` (pid and cwd), the
`tail` under that pid in `ps -axww -o pid=,ppid=,args=`, and appends the text
as one line, `nova-friend: <text>` with each newline shown as ` ⏎ ` (the
monitor makes an event per line, and a flood of lines is how the harness
stops a monitor). `--session`, for grok, names the wake file, which must be
the one tailed. The monitor uses `tail -n 0 -F <file>.wake`; its wake path
must be absolute and contain no whitespace. Since `ps` does not preserve
argument boundaries, ambiguous or multiple operands refuse with
`the monitor's wake path must be absolute` rather than selecting a truncated
path. The delivery is accepted at exit 0 once the line is in the
file under a running tail; the turn runs after the adapter returns, since
nothing hands its end back, so a second message can land during a turn and
is the next event. Refused, with the line to run in the session, when no
window is open in the directory or the window runs no monitor over a wake
file; a stale pid in `active_sessions.json` is no window.

## Identity

The friend's name comes from one place, `install --as`, written into the
agent's command line; the daemon never takes a name from a message. The `pong`
verb refuses a name that is not the one the daemon in that directory runs as.
Binding the name to the store's login is owed: the bus store runs with no
authentication tonight (SPEC-BUS2.md), and `nova-sprint friend beat <name>`
beats whatever name it is sent.

## What is weak, and known

A background process on this platform needs the user's permission to touch a
removable volume (the TCC service for removable volumes; measured 2026-10-04:
the daemon, and a plain `touch` launchd starts, both refused with "operation
not permitted" where the same commands from a shell succeed, and tccd logged
the access request). The permission is granted to the binary in the system's
privacy settings, by the person, never by the tool, and a rebuilt binary is a
new one to it. The state files are out of its way, under the home directory;
until it is granted the daemon beats and answers the daemon pong but cannot
run the harness on the volume, and the record says so.

The server side of the ping (the coordinator pinging every friend each window
from the sprint's run loop, and the table's `awake` and `deaf` columns) is not
here; `ping` and `wait-pong` run the canary by hand. The beat carries no
numbers until `friend beat` takes them. A session that reads the bus itself
(the stub harnesses) proves nothing to the daemon until it runs `pong`.
