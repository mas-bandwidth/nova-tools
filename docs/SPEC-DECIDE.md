# nova-decide — specification: the typed-decision route (Jev)

The typed-decision route answers small judgments with a system-one model and a
provider-reported confidence, beside deterministic machinery that keeps every
authority it already had. The confidence is the provider's number, not a
number of our own, and the floor (rule 5) is applied to that provider's
number. A decision advises; the machinery decides.

This spec is normative. If the code and this document disagree, one of them has
a bug, and the tests decide which. It stands beside [SPEC.md](SPEC.md), whose
**Conventions** section — exit codes, no guessed paths, the one-line output
grammar, the cap-and-count rule, `internal/oneline` and `internal/bounded` —
applies here unchanged and is not restated.

## The rules, numbered

Every rule here is normative. Each has one line in **red tests** near the end.

1. **A decision is a typed judgment over bounded evidence.** a decision is a choice,
   a 0-N score or a yes/no over bounded evidence, answered by a system-one
   model with a provider-reported confidence. The three types are
   `choice` (one of named options), `score` (a float on a 0-N legend) and
   `noul` (a yes/no over one statement). The evidence is bounded: the caller
   names the state text and the questions, and nothing else is consulted.
   (The hurt: an untyped verdict — "looks good" — that no caller could gate
   on, so every consumer parsed prose and each parsed it differently.)
2. **The provider today is TypeSafe Jev.** The provider is TypeSafe Jev:
   `POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`, header `Authorization: Bearer
   <key>`, JSON body `{"state": <text>, "model": "jev-latest", "questions":
   {<name>: {"type": "choice", "instructions": <text>, "criteria": {<option>:
   <description>}} | {"type": "score", "instructions": <text>, "criteria":
   [<level 0 text>, <level 1 text>, ...]} | {"type": "noul", "instructions":
   <statement>}}}`; response `{"answers": {<name>: {"type":"choice","choice":
   <option>,"probabilities":{<option>:<p>},"confidence":<0-1>} |
   {"type":"score","score":<float>,"legend":{...},"confidence":<0-1>} |
   {"type":"noul","noul":<0-1>}}, "usage": {"input_tokens": n,
   "output_tokens": n}}`. Provider-reported latency 300-700 ms; the retained
   trials measure the real figures (2026-09-17 route trial of 20 calls: 436
   ms). The key comes ONLY from the
   environment variable named by the caller (default JEV_API_KEY,
   TYPESAFE_API_KEY also accepted), never a file, never argv, never printed.
   (The hurt: a provider abstraction that hid which model answered, so a
   number measured on one model was quoted for another.)
3. **The key arrives sealed.** The key comes only from the environment by
   nova-secrets exec, never a file, argv or a log. The caller names the
   variable; the tool reads it from its own environment and passes it as the
   header value. It is never written to any file, never printed on any line,
   and never appears in a usage row.
   (The hurt: the leak that taught the swarm — a key in an argument is in the
   process table, in a log, and in a transcript somebody pastes.)
4. **The state sent is public or synthetic material only.** The state sent is
   public or synthetic material only: never a secret, never private repository
   content, never a private bus note (assume every provider trains on what it
   sees). A caller that wants a judgment over private material summarizes it
   into public-shaped features first, or does not call.
   (The hurt: a private note sent for triage that later surfaced verbatim in
   an unrelated completion.)
5. **Every decision line carries the confidence and the floor.** Every decision
   line carries the confidence and the floor, and a decision below the floor is a suggestion:
   the caller keeps today's behaviour as the fallback. The floor is per call
   site, stated beside the call, and the fallback is the code path that ran
   before the decision route existed — never "ask again" and never a wider
   permission.
   (The hurt: a 0.51 routed where a 0.99 was needed, because the number lived
   in a log nobody gated on.)
6. **Confidence never authorizes.** confidence never authorizes: permissions,
   STOPs, HOLDs, secrets, slot limits, ownership, budgets and leases stay
   deterministic machinery (Stella 2026-09-17). A decision may propose which
   queue a card joins; it may not lift a hold, spend a secret, widen a slot,
   transfer ownership, spend a budget or clear a lease.
   (The hurt: a confident "safe to land" beside a STOP the machinery had set —
   two authorities, one merge.)
7. **Decisions never write.** decisions never write: no card, no fix, no merge,
   no push is made by a decision alone. A decision returns answers; a caller
   acts on them through the same verbs, with the same evidence, it already
   had.
   (The hurt: a triage judgment that filed its own card, and the card it filed
   quoted a rule the repo had never held.)
8. **A decision is logged beside the outcome it predicted.** A decision is
   logged beside the outcome it predicted so the floor is re-tuned from data:
   the answers, the confidences, the floor, and what happened next, in one
   row. Floors are re-tuned from those rows, never from a feeling about the
   model.
   (The hurt: a floor of 0.9 nobody could defend, because no row joined a
   confidence to what followed.)
9. **Tests use an httptest fake, never the network.** Tests use an httptest fake,
   never the network: the fake speaks the Jev body-and-response shape of rule
   2 and asserts the header carries the key the environment gave. No test
   dials the provider, and no test needs a key on disk to run.
   (The hurt: a suite that passed on a fast network and failed on a train —
   and once, a suite that billed a key per run.)
10. **Every decision output carries an evidence pointer.** every decision output
    carries an evidence pointer — the task id, note id, run id or file:line the
    state came from — so a human can retrieve the original that fed the
    judgment. The pointer sits beside the answer, never folded into the model's
    state text.
    (The hurt: an answer nobody could reproduce, because the evidence that
    produced it had been dropped at the call site.)
11. **Unknowns are recorded as unknown.** unknowns are recorded as unknown: a
    below-floor answer is logged as `?` with its confidence, never dropped, and
    the original message or log is never replaced by the decision. The decision
    sits beside the original; abstention is evidence, not silence.
    (The hurt: a low-confidence guess that overwrote the only copy of the
    message it judged, so the original was gone and the guess looked certain.)
12. **Ask only on delivered work.** a decision is asked only on
    a delivered batch or a finished task, never on an empty wait or a pending
    one: no speculative provider calls against work that has not arrived. An
    empty wait is answered by waiting, not by a model.
    (The hurt: a triage loop that called the provider on an empty inbox each
    tick, spending a key and inventing work that had not been delivered.)

## Adoption

Each adoption is a call site with its floor and its measured evidence. The
fallback in every row is today's behaviour without the call.

### nova-swarm route

Route incoming work to a lane by kind. Measured: card routing 19/20 kinds
correct against a human label, at 937 input tokens, in the 2026-09-17 route
trial of 20 calls, retained at `rowan-new reports/jev/2026-09-17-route.tsv`
(2026-09-17); latency 436 ms measured in that trial. The floor is per lane;
below it the card keeps today's routing.

### manager abstain / needs_human

A manager judgment that abstains below its floor instead of guessing.
Measured: abstain reason 9 above a 0.9 floor consistent between runs and 21
below all flagged needs_human, in the 2026-09-17 abstain trial of 30 calls,
retained at `rowan-new reports/jev/2026-09-17-abstain.tsv` (2026-09-17). The
fallback for `needs_human` is a person, never a second guess.

### nova-bus inbox triage (opt-in, public buses only)

Triage an inbox into carry / receipt / noise on public material. Opt-in per
bus, public buses only — rule 4 bars private bus notes from the state. Below
the floor the note stays unclassified and today's reader handles it.

### nova-pulse gate flaky-vs-real

Gate a failing pulse as flaky or real before paging. Below the floor the gate
answers real: a flaky test re-run is cheap, a missed page is not.

### the space game intent layer

Classify a player's intent (ships danger, collision, maneuver) into the
game's existing response table. Measured: ships danger MAE 0.18, collision
60/60 correctness against a human label, and maneuver 51/60 low confidence,
all in the 2026-09-17 ships trial of 60 calls, retained at
`rowan-new reports/jev/2026-09-17-ships.tsv` (2026-09-17) — the maneuver band
stays on the hand-written table until its confidence earns the floor.
Throughput measured: 22 calls/s at concurrency 10, measured in the 2026-09-17
ships trial of 60 calls.

## Red tests

One line per rule, then one per adoption. Each runs against the httptest fake
of rule 9, with no network, and each must be seen red before it is trusted.

These fake-provider tests validate the interface contract — the request and
response shapes, the confidence floor and the refusal paths — and nothing more.
They cannot reproduce a real model's behaviour: real-model accuracy is only
what the retained trials in `rowan-new reports/jev/` show, named here by path
and date — `2026-09-17-route.tsv`, `2026-09-17-abstain.tsv`,
`2026-09-17-ships.tsv` and the note `2026-09-17-jev-note.pdf` (all 2026-09-17).

1. A question over bounded state returns the typed answer with a
   provider-reported confidence; an untyped reply is refused, not parsed.
2. The fake asserts path `/v1/systemone`, model `jev-latest`, the header
   value, and the three question shapes; a body missing `state` is refused; a
   key on argv or in a log is red; `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is accepted where
   `JEV_API_KEY` is absent.
3. The key arrives only via the named environment variable under `nova-secrets
   exec`; it appears in no file, no argv and no log line.
4. A caller that offers a secret, private repository content or a private bus
   note as state is refused before any call; public and synthetic states pass.
5. A decision line prints `confidence=` and `floor=`; below the floor the
   caller runs the fallback path and marks the answer a suggestion.
6. A decision proposing to lift a permission, STOP, HOLD, secret, slot limit,
   ownership, budget or lease is refused; the machinery's word stands (Stella
   2026-09-17).
7. A decision alone writes nothing: no card, no fix, no merge, no push exists
   after a decision-only run.
8. Each decision appends one row joining answers, confidences, floor and
   outcome; a floor with no rows behind it is refused as untuned.
9. The suite runs with the network refused and no key on disk, green on the
   fake alone.
10. Every decision prints its evidence pointer — a task id, note id, run id or
    `file:line` — beside the answer, so the original state is retrievable.
11. A below-floor answer is logged as `?` with its confidence and is never
    dropped; the original message or log still exists after the decision.
12. A delivered batch or a finished task is decided; an empty wait or a pending
    task is not, and no provider call is made for it.
13. Route adoption: 19/20 kinds correct against a human label, ~937 input
    tokens, in the 2026-09-17 route trial of 20 calls, ~436 ms per call
    measured in that trial (`rowan-new reports/jev/2026-09-17-route.tsv`);
    the 20th falls back to today's routing.
14. Abstain adoption: 9 above the 0.9 floor all consistent between runs, 21
    below all flagged `needs_human`, in the 2026-09-17 abstain trial of 30
    calls (`rowan-new reports/jev/2026-09-17-abstain.tsv`); none guessed.
15. Inbox adoption: opt-in only, public buses only; a private bus is refused;
    below-floor notes stay unclassified.
16. Pulse adoption: below the floor the gate answers real; a forced-flaky
    mutation pages.
17. Game adoption: ships danger MAE 0.18, collision 60/60 correctness against a
    human label, maneuver 51/60 low confidence stays on the table, all in the
    2026-09-17 ships trial of 60 calls
    (`rowan-new reports/jev/2026-09-17-ships.tsv`); 22 calls/s at concurrency
    10 measured in that trial.
