// nova-work is both the thin client of the resident work session (docs/SPEC-WORK.md,
// "The engine and its client") and the kernel's side of the work description language
// (docs/SPEC-WORKLANG.md) and the job graph of docs/SPEC-JOBS.md.
//
// The client sends ONE request line over the Unix socket --session names,
// newline-terminated, and prints the ONE line the session answers, byte for byte: OK, ROW,
// NOTE and MORE to stdout and exit 0, FAIL, RACED and REFUSED to stderr and exit 1. What
// cannot run at all -- no verb, no --session, no socket that answers -- is one WORK REFUSED
// line on stderr, exit 2, ending "run: nova-work help". The values travel as the caller
// spelled them and the session validates every one.
//
// The bounded reader: `plan check` reads one plan under --max-bytes, --max-depth and
// --max-nodes, refuses a `#.` dispatch macro at the byte offset that owes it, refuses any
// input past a bound whole rather than truncated, and refuses an unknown `:kind` by field
// name. It then closes the plan's needs/blocks graph at load: `:needs` is the
// reference edge and `:blocks` its inverse, an absent need is refused naming the field
// and the id, and a `:needs` cycle is refused by validator rule 3 before publication. A
// well-formed plan prints one line; a refusal is exit 2 with one remedy line.
//
// The job graph: typed needs and blocks edges, refused acyclic at seed by validator rule
// 3, and the mechanical ready set launch reads. A node is ready only when every need is
// terminal accepted. Every row that cannot proceed prints its exact blocker and its
// resolver; a card whose need is an open PR is never on a slot. This slice owns the
// in-process graph and the ready reading only: no Redis, no network, no launch, no lease.
//
// Every path comes from a flag. There is no default file and no discovery: a missing
// flag is a refusal, never a guess. Output is one line per verb. Exit 0 ran and passed;
// exit 2 could not run -- a missing flag, an unreadable graph or plan, a :deps cycle, an
// unknown node, a refusal.
//
// nova-work is also the work layer's event bridge. This binary's shipped verb, events,
// turns the cards:done stream and the gh fallback poll into the pub/sub messages the
// merge layer reacts to (docs/SPEC-JOBS.md, "Events, not ticks"). It makes no model call
// and writes no record: every message is a signal, and git stays the record.

wire:
  one line in, one line out over the Unix socket --session names. The request
  line is the verb and its flags in the order above, each as --name <value>,
  values escaped through internal/oneline's field form (one token per value:
  a space is \x20, an equals is \x3d), bools as --name true, the whole line
  newline-terminated. The reply is the session's own answer line, printed byte
  for byte: OK, ROW, NOTE and MORE to stdout, exit 0; FAIL, RACED and REFUSED
  to stderr, exit 1. What cannot run at all is one WORK REFUSED line on
  stderr, exit 2, ending "run: nova-work help". Values travel as given: the
  session validates every one and refuses with its own naming.

verbs:
  nova-work dependencies   owns the graph (:deps, refused acyclic at seed by validator rule 3)
  nova-work ready --node X is the ready set
  nova-work clip           commits the card's branch, harvests its result, resets the worktree to base
  nova-work plan check     reads a .work plan as data and closes its needs/blocks graph, never as a program
  nova-work plan expand    writes one card directory per hand-written :node, refusing a cycle or an absent need
  nova-work set check      reads the (work-set ...) form a coordinator writes and validates it whole
  nova-work ask            delivers ONE unit to the FRIEND who owns it, as a bus note
  nova-work asks           the open asks, oldest first, with their age and their deadline
  nova-work events         bridges the events, not ticks (cards:done stream + gh fallback poll)

THE MACHINERY ROUTES TO FRIENDS (Glenn, 2026-09-18). A bench pulls cards; a friend pulls
asks. A unit whose owner is a friend is therefore never cut as a card: ask renders it as
ONE note in the house shape -- To, Cc, Subject, the unit, its lane, its needs, its
acceptance, the deadline and the branch to reply on -- and sends it through nova-bus's
OWN send path. An ask that could not be sent records nothing.

--units reads EITHER form, read from the file's first byte rather than its name: the
JSON shape this tool writes, or the SPEC-WORKLANG work set a coordinator writes by hand,
through the same bounded reader plan check uses. A JSON work set has the ask written
back onto its unit. A SPEC-WORKLANG one is a person's document and is NEVER written back:
the ask goes to --record when one is named, and otherwise the note on the bus is the
record -- which is what asks --bus --as reads. The bus is the source of truth for what
went out, and where a row appears in both, the bus's wins.

A unit with no :acceptance is asked, not refused: not one unit of the real work set
carries one, so the title stands as the acceptance, the note says "Acceptance: as titled"
and one ASK NOTE line on stderr says the unit carried none. A deadline is still never
guessed: --deadline, or the unit's own :deadline, and a unit with neither is refused.
The sender is on the Cc line of every ask it sends, because a broadcast includes self.

A node is ready only when every need is terminal accepted, and every row that cannot
proceed prints its exact blocker and its resolver. A :deps cycle is refused before
publication, so the ready set is finite and the graph can never deadlock.

A plan is read as data, never as a program: a ` + "`#.`" + ` dispatch macro anywhere in code
position is refused at exit 2 naming its byte offset, string and comment text is opaque,
and an unknown :kind is refused naming the field. :needs is the reference edge and
:blocks its inverse, so the kernel derives whichever a node did not give; an absent
need is refused naming the field and the id, and a :needs cycle is refused by validator
rule 3, both at load before the graph is published.

set check reads the OTHER top form of the same language: not ` + "`(:plan ...)`" + `, the
expander's, but ` + "`(work-set \"id\" ... :units ((unit ...)))`" + `, the one a coordinator
writes. It is read by the SAME bounded reader -- three bounds, no eval, a dispatch macro
refused at the byte that owes it -- and a key this reader does not know is KEPT, never
refused: the work set is a person's document and a unit with a :pr or a :budget is still
a unit with an owner. What set check then validates is the CONTENT, and the two exit
codes say different things. Exit 2 is a refusal: this file could not be read at all.
Exit 1 is findings: it was read whole and its content is wrong -- a duplicate id, a
:needs naming a unit nobody defined, a cycle, an :owner no --minds registry names, a
:lane no --lanes file names, a :deadline that is not an instant. Every rule runs over
every unit in ONE pass, one SET line per finding, because a checker that stopped at the
first would cost one round trip per defect. The SET OK line prints either way, and
units = ready + blocked + done closes its arithmetic.

--ready is the mechanical ready set, derived from the language rather than maintained by
hand: a unit is done when it says so (:done, or a :status of closed, done, landed or
merged) or when --done names it, and ready when it is not done and every need is done.
Without --minds and without --lanes those two rules are OFF rather than run against a
guessed file: there is no default registry and no discovery.

events publishes the family's three event channels from two sources: the cards:done
stream (consumer group events) becomes card-done, and a poll of gh every --gh-poll
becomes pr-checks-done on a changed check-suite conclusion and dev-moved on a changed
base head. The poll is the fallback heartbeat until the forge pushes a webhook; a quiet
poll publishes nothing. Without --repo only the stream is bridged.

--once reads the stream and polls the forge once, then exits. The loop form requires
--deadline and returns when it is reached.

Every event events publishes is also written as one structured JSON line (SPEC-LOGS.md
Part 2): the same five labels on every line -- source=nova-work, verb=events, bench, the
event kind (start, card-done, pr-checks-done, dev-moved, done) and level -- plus the
fixed fields ts, guid, card, pr, msg, dur_ms and err. The line goes to stderr, which
under systemd is the unit's journal and so a source Alloy already reads, or to the file
--log names, which Alloy tails on every bench. A secret value never reaches the line:
the emitter redacts anything credential-shaped before it leaves the process. The stdout
EVENTS OK line is unchanged; the JSON line is written beside it, never instead of it.

flags:
  --graph <file>  the node graph, as JSON: {"nodes":[{"id":"a","needs":["b"]}, ...]}
                  Required on both graph verbs; there is no default and no discovery.
  --node <id>     dependencies: the node to write a needs edge to, creating it when the
                  graph does not hold it yet. ready: the one node to evaluate; without
                  it, ready prints one row per node in seed order.
  --needs <ids>   a comma-separated list of needs for --node. --needs needs --node;
                  --node alone creates a node needing nothing.
  --file <path>   plan check and plan expand: the plan to read. set check: the work set.
                  Required, always: there is no default file and no discovery from the
                  working directory.
  --minds <file>  set check: the registry an :owner must name, as the decide lane's
                  ladder ({"minds":[{"name":"emma"}...]}), the bus roster
                  ({"participants":[{"name":"Emma"}...]}) or a plain list, one name per
                  line. The shape is READ, not guessed at from the name, and the match
                  folds case. Without it no owner is checked.
  --lanes <file>  set check: the lanes file a :lane must name, <name>\t<path prefixes>
                  per line. Without it no lane is checked.
  --done <ids>    set check: comma-separated unit ids that are done, beside what the
                  file's own :done and :status say.
  --ready         set check: also print one SET READY line per unit of the ready set,
                  each carrying its admission verdict (admit=go, or admit=held with the
                  dimension or path that held it and the unit holding it).
  --out <dir>     plan expand: the directory to write one card per node into. Required;
                  a card already there is left byte-identical, so a re-expansion appends
                  only the new card and mints no id.
  --max-bytes <n> plan check: the byte ceiling (default 65536). A file past it is
                  refused before a byte is parsed, never truncated.
  --max-depth <n> plan check: the nesting ceiling (default 64). A form past it is
                  refused at its opening byte.
  --max-nodes <n> plan check: the atom ceiling (default 4096). A plan past it is refused
                  at the atom's byte.
  --units <file>  ask and asks: the work set, in either form and read as data. JSON:
                  {"units":[{"id":"u1","title":"...","owner":"Emma","lane":"work",
                  "needs":[...],"acceptance":[...],"deadline":"...","branch":"..."}]}.
                  SPEC-WORKLANG: (work-set "id" ... :units ((unit "id" :owner "Stella"
                  :lane "work" :needs (...) :deadline "2026-09-18T18:00Z" :title "..."))).
                  Required on ask; there is no default and no discovery.
  --record <file> ask: where the ask is recorded when --units is SPEC-WORKLANG, which is
                  never rewritten. Without it the bus note is the only record, and one
                  ASK NOTE line says so.
  --owner <name>  ask: the friend the unit belongs to, spelled the way the bus's roster
                  spells it. asks: show only that friend's asks.
  --deadline <t>  ask: when the answer is owed, as 2026-09-18T18:00:00Z or the shorter
                  2026-09-18T18:00Z a person writes. The unit's own :deadline stands when
                  this is absent; a unit with neither is refused, and a deadline that is
                  not after --now is refused before anything is sent.
  --bus <dir>     ask: the bus checkout the note is sent on. asks: the bus to READ the
                  sent notes from, which needs --as and is the source of truth.
  --now <stamp>   ask and asks: the instant deadlines and ages are measured against;
                  the default is this run's clock and an unparsable one is a refusal
                  rather than a silent fall back to it.
  --bench <name>  events: the fleet name of this machine, the bench label on every
                  structured line. Without it, $NOVA_BENCH, else the short hostname.
  --log <path>    events: append the structured JSON lines to this file instead of
                  stderr. The file is the one Alloy tails; a path that cannot be opened
                  is refused naming --log, never a silent run with no log.
